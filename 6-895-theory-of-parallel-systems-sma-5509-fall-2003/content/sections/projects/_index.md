Term projects will be presented in class for the last four class sessions. Your group is also responsible for a project report of 5-10 pages due on the last day of class. About one-third of your term project grade will be from your presentation and two-thirds will be from your project report.

For the final presentation, each group will have about 10-12 minutes times the number of students in your group to make your presentation, plus a few minutes for questions. All students in the group should participate actively in the presentation. Prepare PowerPoint® or other online presentation materials.

The Fall 2003 student projects are provided below.
